        <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
        <p class="content">
          Due to the unique nature of socoology, no course is directly offered by the department. Rather, coolness is <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707029" target="_blank">everywhere</a>. The major is designed to develop scholars’ abilities to discover, appreciate, and critically analyze coolness. As the most prestigious major (definitely not because it is the only one offered) at the University of Coolcago, Socoology pushes every scholar out of their comfort zones, exploring the coolness across different fields. Therefore, scholars majoring in Socoology are required to leverage the diversity of their liberal arts education by enrolling in courses from at least <strong>20</strong> other disciplines during their four years at UCoolcago. At the end of each quarter, in order for a course to count, scholars need to submit <strong>5</strong> cool findings<sup>1</sup> from each course to the department for approval.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Furthermore, the major challenges every scholar to investigate coolness through a purely objective lens. Scholars must respect, though not necessarily agree with, the subjectivity of their (un)cool subjects, and the department considers this an indispensable attitude of a socoologist. At least <strong>1/3</strong> of all courses must be taught with the <a href="images/socratic.jpg" target="_blank">Socratic</a> method. UCoolcago is known for its unlike-minded, nerdy<sup>2</sup>, quirky students across all departments. Because every student is so intellectually uncommon in a peculiar field, the student body is full of different opinions. Through frequent Socratic-style discussions, socoology majors benefit from the conflicts of opinions and creative abrasion, thereby broadening their outlook on the social spectrum from uncoolness to coolness. After getting habitually challenged by their peers, scholars will develop the mindset that empowers them to stay cool and unbiased in pursuit of true findings.

          <em>1. Findings must be purely intellectual! For instance, “the classroom’s air conditioner is too cool” is not a valid finding! </em>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          <em>2. The only legitimate definition of “nerdy” here at UCoolcago is “characterized by an obsessive interest in something.” It is the highest compliment of intellect one can ever receive. Every year, only three students are awarded the highest distinction <em>nerda cum laude</em> for their most obsessive, profound, and quirky intellectual interests. </em>

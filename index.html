        <h2>What is Socoology?</h2>
        <p id="primary">
          <em>"We are socoologically cool. We are cool socoologists."</em> – Anchen Dong, Founder of the discipline Socoology
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          The discipline of socoology examines everything that is so (un)cool about our society and the social world in the dimension of culture, fashion, entertainment, temperature, and any dimension one can think of. <em>Why are hookups considered cool in one culture but taboo in another? Do college students wear Canada Goose to be physically uncool or just to be socially cool?</em> These are the kinds of cool questions socoologists contemplate every day.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Coolness is predominantly subjective. Being cool can mean lacking friendliness to one but signifying attractiveness to the other. Likewise, some feel cool when it is 20 Celsius, while some feel cool when it is -20 Celsius. Hence, the discipline is built in its entirety on the grounds of tacit knowledge and abstract ideas. Socoologists are committed to reaching unbiased and objective findings through subjective evidence. Consequently, socoologists need to equip themselves with methodologies that fundamentally rely on primary human interaction. Despite their incredible passion for what they study, socoologists investigate social phenomena in a truly cool manner. Socoologists display absolutely no emotion, neither enthusiasm nor anxiety, when conducting research, and they would first put gloves on to insulate their subjects from the researchers’ temperature and subjectivity before probing.

        <h2>Cool Thesis</h2>
        <p class="content">
          Socoology majors are required to complete an original research project. This culminates in the COOL thesis. However, scholars will be evaluated mainly on the coolness of their topics and research methods rather than the thesis itself. This parallels the department’s teaching philosophy that emphasizes the learning process and spirit rather than results.

          Recent projects have included:

          1. Ever since <em>Gangnam Style</em>, how has K-pop grown its coolness and popularity worldwide? While Korean speakers are outnumbered by speakers of various other Asian languages, K-pop’s global influence is the most phenomenal, right after English and Spanish music. The project critically examined the spread of the Korean Wave over social media and how it served as a bridge between Eastern and Western cultures. It took an interdisciplinary approach from the aspects of linguistics, music, and visual studies and analyzed their contribution to our cultural society.

          2. Why is our society getting uncooler and uncooler? Of course, the answer is evident - global warming. However, why has it been intensifying in an unstoppable manner throughout the past decades? Many people believe that global warming is economically and technologically inevitable, yet is that really the case? The project aimed to reveal the social barriers against mitigating climate change (e.g., tragedy of the commons and bystander apathy). To continually remind himself of how precious coolness is, the author buried himself in the snow of Coolcago whenever he worked on his COOL thesis.
